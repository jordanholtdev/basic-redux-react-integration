  Basic Redux Example

## Introduction

Just a basic integration of Redux and React. I created this as part of training course I was taking.

### Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) v17.0.1
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/) v4.0.5
- [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) v7.2.2
- [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)

## Getting Started

Install the dependecies

```sh
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
